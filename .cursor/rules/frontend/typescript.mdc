# TypeScript / JavaScript

## Types
- Prefer `unknown` over `any`; narrow with type guards.
- Avoid unsafe assertions (`as Foo`) unless you validate first.
- Keep public APIs typed; don’t leak `any` across boundaries.

## Async + errors
- Don’t swallow errors; return meaningful failures or throw with context.
- Handle `Promise` rejections explicitly; avoid floating promises.

## Structure
- Keep modules small and cohesive; extract helpers when reuse emerges.
- Prefer pure functions; isolate side effects (IO, time, randomness).

## Tooling
- If the repo has ESLint/Prettier/tsconfig rules, follow them exactly.
- When adding files, match existing import style and path aliasing.

## Tests
- For behavior changes, add/adjust unit tests near the change.
