# World Seed project template

This repository contains a minimal full‑stack template aligned with the local Cursor rules:

- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React + Vite (+ Redux Toolkit)
- **Backend**: Java + Spring Boot + Maven (+ Liquibase, springdoc-openapi)

Folders:

- `frontend` – SPA client application.
- `backend` – REST backend and persistence layer.

You can treat this as a starting point and evolve it as needed.
